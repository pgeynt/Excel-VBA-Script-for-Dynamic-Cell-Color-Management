This VBA script is designed to automate a specific function in Excel. It is triggered when a user selects a cell or group of cells. The script checks for the presence of cells filled with lavender color (RGB(230, 230, 250)) in the selected row, up to column "U". If it finds any cell filled with lavender, it retains the changes made to that row. If no lavender-filled cells are present in the newly selected row, it reverts any previously altered cells back to their original state (removing the lavender fill) within the previous selection up to column "U". Additionally, if the current selection does not contain any lavender-filled cells, it fills blank or white cells (RGB(255, 255, 255) or no fill) with lavender color within the row, up to column "U". This script ensures that only the most recently selected row without lavender-filled cells gets updated, maintaining a clean and organized appearance in the worksheet.
